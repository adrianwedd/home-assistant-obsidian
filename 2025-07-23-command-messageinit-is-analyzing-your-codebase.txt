     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when
     working with code in this repository.
     ## Project Overview
     This is a Home Assistant Community Add-on that wraps the
     `lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian` container to provide Obsidian as an
     embedded web UI within Home Assistant. The add-on is designed as a pure
      wrapper without a Dockerfile, keeping it lightweight and always
     up-to-date with the upstream container.
     ## Architecture

     ☒ Check for existing CLAUDE.md file
     ☒ Read README.md for project overview
     ☒ Identify build, test, and lint commands
     ☒ Create CLAUDE.md file
     ☒ Check for Cursor/Copilot rules

⏺ I've created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for your Home Assistant
  Obsidian add-on repository. The file includes:

  - Development commands: ha dev addon lint, pytest commands, pre-commit
  hooks
  - Architecture overview: Key directories and their purposes, focusing on
  the wrapper design
  - Configuration details: Important files like config.yaml with validation
   requirements
  - Commit conventions: ADDON-XXX format requirement
  - CI/CD setup: Lint and release workflows, Renovate integration

  The file focuses on the essential information future Claude instances
  need to be productive, including the unique aspects of this being a
  container wrapper rather than a custom build, and the specific
  development workflow for Home Assistant add-ons.
