## ðŸ§  Obsidian â€“ Home Assistant Addâ€‘on | Headless. Web-based. Full Control

This addâ€‘on wraps the **sytone/obsidian-remote** container, giving you a web-based version of Obsidian accessible from the Home Assistant sidebar via Ingress.

â§– This container isnâ€™t just an add-onâ€”itâ€™s your vault interface to structured knowledge under total local control. Built to be elegant, unbloated, and composable with your cognitive workflows.

### Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `puid` | int | `1000` | Linux userâ€‘ID that owns files inside the vault. |
| `pgid` | int | `1000` | Linux groupâ€‘ID that owns files. |
| `tz`   | str | `UTC`  | Timeâ€‘zone string (e.g. `Australia/Sydney`). |

> On most Linux hosts run `id -u` and `id -g` to discover your UID/GID.

After editing, **Save** then **Restart** the addâ€‘on for changes to take effect.

---

### Accessing Obsidian

1. Start the addâ€‘on, wait â‰ˆÂ 30â€¯s for firstâ€‘time initialisation.
2. Click **Open Web UI** (or the ðŸ§  sidebar icon to enter vaultspace).
3. In the web UI, choose **Create new vault** and point it to `/config/MyVault`.
   `/config` inside the container maps to the addâ€‘onâ€™s persistent `/data` directory.

---

### Data & Backups

* All vault data lives in `/data` â€“ automatically included in HA snapshots.
* Snapshots stay lean thanks to:

  ```yaml
  backup_exclude:
    - BrowserCache/
    - .cache/
  ```

You can restore a snapshot on a new HA instance and your vault reâ€‘appears intact.

---

### Resource Use

* Typical idle RAM â‰ˆâ€¯350â€‘450â€¯MB, peaks â‰ˆâ€¯600â€¯MB during heavy vault sync
* CPU load is modest; rendering is softwareâ€‘only in v0.1
* Automatic restart via healthcheck keeps the UI responsive
GODMODE builds should log metrics to `/config/perf.json` for long-term vault performance tuning.

---

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Blank screen / reconnect loop | Clear browser siteâ€‘data or restart the addâ€‘on. |
| Vault not saved | Ensure you created it under `/config/â€¦`; anything under `/home` vanishes on restart. |
| Addâ€‘on keeps restarting | Check Supervisor log â€“ watchdog fires if portÂ 8080 stops responding. |

---

### Changelog

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| `1.5.14` | 2025â€‘07â€‘23 | Updated to headless sytone/obsidian-remote image with `latest` tag. |
