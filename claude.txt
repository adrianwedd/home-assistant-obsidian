> without investing too much effort, can you identify why this doesn't work using the docker image we're using?

⏺ I need more context to help you identify what doesn't work. Could you please specify:

  1. What specific functionality or feature isn't working?
  2. What error messages or symptoms are you seeing?
  3. What Docker image are you referring to (I see you're using lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian based on the project)?

  Once you provide these details, I can investigate the issue for you.

  2025-07-23 11:05:32.918 homeassistant addon_c9a82807_obsidian[654]: (EE)

⏺ Based on the error logs, the issue is that the lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian image is failing to start its X11/VNC server due to graphics buffer management (GBM) initialization failures. This is happening because:

  1. "Failed to create gbm" - The container can't initialize graphics buffers, likely due to missing GPU access or drivers
  2. Display/X11 issues - VNC server can't start properly without working graphics subsystem
  3. Privilege/mount issues - Missing kernel modules and read-only filesystem restrictions

  The LinuxServer Obsidian image expects to run with graphics capabilities that aren't available in the Home Assistant add-on environment. Home Assistant add-ons run in a restricted container environment without GPU access or the
  ability to load kernel modules.

  This image is designed for standalone Docker deployments with full system access, not for Home Assistant's sandboxed add-on architecture. You'd need either:

  - A different Obsidian image built specifically for headless/web-only operation
  - Additional privileges/capabilities in the add-on config (which may not be possible/safe)
  - An alternative approach like running Obsidian in a different container architecture
