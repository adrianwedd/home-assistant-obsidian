## 📖 Message Structure

### Header Line (50 chars max)
```
🎯 enhance: elevate container security architecture
```

### Body (72 chars per line)
```
Transform the Obsidian container from a privileged, mount-conflict
prone system into an elegant, security-first architecture that
harmonizes perfectly with Home Assistant's design philosophy.

Key improvements:
• Ubuntu 22.04 foundation with purpose-built components
• noVNC web interface eliminating Docker-in-Docker complexity
• NGINX reverse proxy optimized for HA Ingress integration
• Comprehensive health monitoring and graceful service management

This architectural evolution resolves persistent mount permission
conflicts while maintaining full Obsidian functionality and
enhancing overall system reliability.
