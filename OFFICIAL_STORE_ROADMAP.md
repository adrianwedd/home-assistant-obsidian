### Phase 3: Official Submission Preparation üìã

#### Home Assistant Community Add-ons Requirements
- [ ] **Repository Structure**
  - Follow official add-on repository structure exactly
  - Ensure all required files are present and correctly formatted
  - Add proper licensing (typically Apache 2.0)

- [ ] **Quality Gates**
  - Pass all automated linting and validation
  - Demonstrate stable operation over time
  - Show active maintenance and support
  - Provide evidence of community usage

#### Submission Process
- [ ] **Create Submission PR**

  - Make required changes and improvements
  - Demonstrate ongoing maintenance commitment

### Phase 4: Official Store Integration üè™

#### Post-Acceptance
- [ ] **Migration Guide**
  - Help users migrate from custom repository
  - Provide clear upgrade instructions
  - Maintain backward compatibility

- [ ] **Ongoing Maintenance**
  - Regular updates aligned with upstream container
  - Security patches and bug fixes
  - Community support and issue resolution

## Technical Considerations

### Security Review Priorities
1. **Minimize Privileges**: Research if `SYS_ADMIN` can be replaced with more specific capabilities
2. **Container Security**: Audit container for security best practices
3. **Network Security**: Ensure proper ingress configuration

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Container Strategy**: Continue pure wrapper approach vs. custom build
2. **Version Management**: Tag alignment with upstream vs. independent versioning
3. **Configuration Options**: Balance simplicity vs. flexibility

### Quality Metrics for Acceptance
- [ ] Zero critical security issues
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] Sub-30 second startup time
- [ ] Multi-architecture support verified
- [ ] Active community of 100+ users
- [ ] 6+ months of stable operation

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1** (Polish): 2-4 weeks
- **Phase 2** (Community Validation): 2-3 months
- **Phase 3** (Submission Prep): 2-4 weeks
- **Phase 4** (Review Process): 1-3 months (depends on reviewers)

**Total Timeline**: 6-10 months to official store

## Success Criteria

### Immediate (Phase 1)
- [ ] All linting passes
- [ ] Multi-arch containers work
- [ ] Security review complete
- [ ] Documentation comprehensive

### Medium-term (Phase 2)
- [ ] 50+ community users providing feedback
- [ ] 95%+ positive user experience
- [ ] Zero critical bugs reported
- [ ] Active community engagement

### Long-term (Phase 4)
