## Obsidian â€“ Home Assistant Addâ€‘on

This addâ€‘on wraps the official **linuxserver/obsidian** container, giving you a full desktop version of Obsidian accessible from the Home Assistant sidebar via Ingress.

It follows the "pure wrapper" philosophy â€“ no Dockerfile here â€“ so updates are instant and always track upstream.

### Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `puid` | int | `1000` | Linux userâ€‘ID that owns files inside the vault. |
| `pgid` | int | `1000` | Linux groupâ€‘ID that owns files. |
| `tz`   | str | `UTC`  | Timeâ€‘zone string (e.g. `Australia/Sydney`). |

> On most Linux hosts run `id -u` and `id -g` to discover your UID/GID.

After editing, **Save** then **Restart** the addâ€‘on for changes to take effect.

### Accessing Obsidian

1. Start the addâ€‘on, wait â‰ˆÂ 30â€¯s for firstâ€‘time initialisation.  
2. Click **Open Web UI** or the ðŸ§  Obsidian sidebar entry.  
3. In the VNC desktop choose **Create new vault** and point it to `/config/MyVault`.  
   `/config` inside the container maps to the addâ€‘onâ€™s persistent `/data` directory.

---

### Data & Backups

* All vault data lives in `/data` â€“ automatically included in HA snapshots.  
* Snapshots stay lean thanks to:

  ```yaml
  backup_exclude:
    - BrowserCache/
    - .cache/
  ```

You can restore a snapshot on a new HA instance and your vault reâ€‘appears intact.

---

### Resource Use

* Typical idle RAM â‰ˆâ€¯350â€‘450â€¯MB, peaks â‰ˆâ€¯600â€¯MB during heavy vault sync  
* CPU load is modest; rendering is softwareâ€‘only in v1.0  
* The addâ€‘on reserves **512â€¯MB** (`memory:` hint) â€“ lowâ€‘RAM devices may show a Supervisor warning  
* Watchdog monitors `http://[HOST]:3000/` to keep the UI responsive

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Blank screen / reconnect loop | Clear browser siteâ€‘data or restart the addâ€‘on. |
| Vault not saved | Ensure you created it under `/config/â€¦`; anything under `/home` vanishes on restart. |
| Addâ€‘on keeps restarting | Check Supervisor log â€“ watchdog fires if portÂ 3000 stops responding. |

---

### Changelog

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| `1.0.0` | 2025â€‘06â€‘22 | Initial public release â€“ pure wrapper, Ingress, multiâ€‘arch. |
