## ðŸ§  Obsidian â€“ Home Assistant Community Add-on | Pure Wrapper. Zero Bloat. Full GODMODE

This addâ€‘on wraps the official **linuxserver/obsidian** container, giving you a full desktop version of Obsidian accessible from the Home Assistant sidebar via Ingress.

It follows the "pure wrapper" philosophy â€“ no Dockerfile here â€“ so updates are instant and always track upstream.

â§– No build chains. No overengineering. This is a fast lane from sidebar to second brain. Upstream fidelity meets Home Assistant elegance.

### Features

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Pure wrapper, zero buildâ€‘time** | Pulls the official multiâ€‘arch `lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian` image â€“ installs in seconds and stays upstreamâ€‘fresh. |
| **Ingressâ€‘first UX** | Obsidianâ€™s KasmVNC desktop appears in the HA sidebar â€“ no extra ports or logins. |
| **Snapshotâ€‘friendly** | Vault lives under `/data`; large browser caches are excluded from HA backups. |
| **Minimal setup** | Only `PUID`, `PGID`, and `TZ` options â€“ sensible defaults included. |
| **Healthcheck & autoâ€‘heal** | Supervisor monitors the UI and restarts automatically on failure. |
| **CIâ€‘powered updates** | Renovate + GitHubÂ Actions bump the image tag and publish signed releases. |

### Quick start

1. **Add repository**
   *Settings â†’ Add-ons â†’ Add-on Store â†’ â‹® â†’ Repositories â†’*

   ```text
   https://github.com/adrianwedd/home-assistant-obsidian
   ```

2. **Install** the **Obsidian** add-on.
3. **Configure** (optional â€“ defaults work on many systems):

   | Option | Default | Notes |
   |--------|---------|-------|
   | `puid` | `1000`  | Numeric user ID for file ownership. Run `id -u` on Linux. |
   | `pgid` | `1000`  | Numeric group ID. Run `id -g` on Linux. |
   | `tz`   | `UTC`   | Time-zone string, e.g. `Europe/London`. |

4. **Start** the add-on â†’ **Open Web UI** (ðŸ§  icon in sidebar = portal to your vault OS).
5. **Create your vault** inside `/config/MyVault` (maps to the add-onâ€™s persistent storage).

The dev container runs `devcontainer_bootstrap` on startup to install test dependencies and start a lightweight Supervisor.

### Contributing

Reflective edits welcome â€“ if your tweak adds resilience, elegance, or creative misuse potential, lean in and PR it.

Use commit messages prefixed with `ADDON-XXX:` where `XXX` matches the task ID.
Run `pre-commit run --all-files` and `ha dev addon lint` before pushing changes.

### Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `puid` | int | `1000` | Linux userâ€‘ID that owns files inside the vault. |
| `pgid` | int | `1000` | Linux groupâ€‘ID that owns files. |
| `tz`   | str | `UTC`  | Timeâ€‘zone string (e.g. `Australia/Sydney`). |

> On most Linux hosts run `id -u` and `id -g` to discover your UID/GID.

After editing, **Save** then **Restart** the addâ€‘on for changes to take effect.

---

### Accessing Obsidian

1. Start the addâ€‘on, wait â‰ˆÂ 30â€¯s for firstâ€‘time initialisation.
2. Click **Open Web UI** or the ðŸ§  Obsidian sidebar entry.
3. In the VNC desktop choose **Create new vault** and point it to `/config/MyVault`.
   `/config` inside the container maps to the addâ€‘onâ€™s persistent `/data` directory.

---

### Data & Backups

* All vault data lives in `/data` â€“ automatically included in HA snapshots.
* Snapshots stay lean thanks to:

  ```yaml
  backup_exclude:
    - BrowserCache/
    - .cache/
  ```

You can restore a snapshot on a new HA instance and your vault reâ€‘appears intact.

---

### Security & Resources

* Runs **unprivileged**; no `full_access` or extra capabilities by default.
* GPU passthrough is **deferred** to a future release.
* Automatic restart via healthcheck keeps the UI responsive.
* Typical idle RAM â‰ˆâ€¯350â€‘450â€¯MB, peaks â‰ˆâ€¯600â€¯MB during heavy vault sync
* CPU load is modest; rendering is softwareâ€‘only in v0.1

---

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Blank screen / reconnect loop | Clear browser siteâ€‘data or restart the addâ€‘on. |
| Vault not saved | Ensure you created it under `/config/â€¦`; anything under `/home` vanishes on restart. |
| Addâ€‘on keeps restarting | Check Supervisor log â€“ watchdog fires if portÂ 3000 stops responding. |
| `Failed to create gbm` in logs | `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` is set by default; mount `/dev/dri` with the `video` group to enable passthrough. |

---

### Changelog

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| `1.5.12` | 2025â€‘06â€‘22 | Initial public release â€“ pure wrapper, Ingress, multiâ€‘arch. |
